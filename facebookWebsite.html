  <h1><u>What is Facebook?</u></h1>
  <p>Facebook is a social networking platform that was founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg. It allows users to create a personal profile, connect with friends and family, share updates, photos, and videos, and join groups and communities based on their interests.
The platform has grown to become one of the largest social media networks in the world, with over 2.8 billion monthly active users as of 2021. Facebook is available in multiple languages and is accessible on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers.

  <h1><u>Facebook Scandal!</u></h1>

</div>
<div id="middleText">
<p>
    In 2013, a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan developed a personality quiz app called "This Is Your Digital Life" on Facebook's platform. The app not only collected data from users who took the quiz but also accessed information about their Facebook friends without their explicit consent.

    Kogan shared the collected data, which included personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users, with the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The firm aimed to use the data to build psychological profiles and target political advertising for its clients, including during the 2016 US presidential election.

    In March 2018, investigative reports by The Guardian and The New York Times exposed the data breach and the unauthorized access to Facebook user data by Cambridge Analytica. The reports brought attention to the potential privacy implications and misuse of personal information.

    The revelation of the scandal sparked widespread public outrage and led to increased scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and privacy advocates. Users expressed concerns about the mishandling of their data and the impact on their privacy.

    Facebook faced backlash for its handling of the situation and its perceived failure to protect user data. CEO Mark Zuckerberg publicly apologized and acknowledged the need for better data protection measures. Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform and initiated an internal investigation.

    Regulatory bodies and government agencies, including the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), launched investigations into Facebook's privacy practices and the Cambridge Analytica incident. Mark Zuckerberg testified before the US Congress and the European Parliament, facing intense questioning about data privacy and user protection.

    The scandal prompted Facebook to make changes to its platform and policies. The company restricted developers' access to user data, implemented stronger privacy controls, and increased transparency. In July 2019, Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC, agreeing to pay a $5 billion fine and implement new privacy measures as part of the settlement.
