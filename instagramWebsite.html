  <h1><u>What is Instagram?</u></h1>
  <p>Instagram is a social media platform that was created in 2010 as a mobile app
    for sharing photos and videos with friends and followers.
    It allows users to post and edit photos and videos, apply filters, and add captions
    and hashtags to their content. The app has since evolved to include a variety of
    features, including messaging, live streaming, and e-commerce capabilities.
  One of the defining features of Instagram is its emphasis on visual content.
  Users can scroll through a feed of photos and videos posted by the accounts they
  follow, and can interact with this content by liking, commenting, and sharing.
  Instagram also offers a range of tools for creators and businesses to engage with
their audiences, including sponsored content, influencer marketing, and analytics.</p>

  <h1><u>Instagram Scandal!</u></h1>

</div>
<div id="middleText">
<p> The European Union's top antitrust regulator, the European Commission, has fined Meta (formerly known as Facebook) over $400 million for violating antitrust rules. The Commission found that Meta was abusing its dominant position in the online advertising market by imposing unfair restrictions on its users' ability to choose how their personal data is used for advertising purposes. Specifically, Meta was found to be requiring users to accept targeted ads as a condition of using its platform, without giving them a real choice to opt out.

In addition to the fine, the Commission has ordered Meta to change its business practices within six months. Specifically, Meta must stop automatically selecting the "Accept All" option for its targeted ad preferences and instead provide users with a genuine choice to accept or reject targeted ads. Meta must also ensure that it does not unfairly disadvantage other companies that compete with it in the online advertising market.

This decision by the European Commission is the latest in a series of antitrust actions against big tech companies in recent years, as regulators around the world seek to rein in the power of these companies and protect consumers' rights. The ruling against Meta is significant, as it sets a clear precedent for other companies to follow and could have a ripple effect throughout the online advertising industry. It remains to be seen how Meta will respond to the ruling and whether it will comply with the Commission's orders, but the company has already indicated that it plans to appeal the decision.
